California,Just pause and think about our home state.,1
California,Just look at the circumstance in our state.,1
California,Consider our state's problems.,1
California,Consider the problems in our state.,1
California,"Here, in our state, we have real challenges to confront.  ",1
California,"For example, consider the challenges our state faces.  ",1
California,Our state faces real environmental challenges.,1

California,"Consider the problems, here in our home state. ",1
California,"In our state, the situation is not good.",1
California,Our situation is not good in our state.,1
California,Climate change doesn't just threaten the polar ice caps.  Take the situation in our state.,1
California,"Here in California, climate change will have real consequences.",1
California,Climate change will especially affect California.,1
California,"The snowpack in the Sierra Nevada is decreasing each year, and climate change will only add to California's water shortages.",2
California,"California is experiencing a severe drought, and rising temperatures will add to the water shortages.",2
California,"We hardly have enough water to sustain our agricultural production, and California's economic condition will be dramatically compromised should climate change make our state even more arid.",2
California,Climate change will increase frequency of drought at the expense of one of California's most valuable commodities: food.,2
California,"It seems as though every summer brings more and more damaging wildfires to California, and evidence shows that climate change is a root cause of these destructive blazes.",2
California,"Wildfires in California negatively impact our air quality, environment, economy, and affect all 31 million residents.  Climate change is worsening the impacts of these fires, and we need to work harder to reduce carbon emissions.",2
California,"California is known for its superior and bountiful produce, but to maintain production we need water.  Climate change is causing droughts in California, and we need to work harder to protect our agricultural water supply.",2
California,"Given California's limited water resources and climate change's role in decreasing rainfall, if we don't conserve water more effectively, we won't have enough to grow food, supply residents, and sustain our lives and economies.",2
California,"If climate change continues to reduce rainfall and increase evaporation from canals, we can expect irrigation water—and soil—salt concentrations to increase. Plants cannot survive in saline soils, and I am concerned for our region's food supply.",2
California,"The snowfall—and snowpack—in the Sierras has dramatically decreased in the past few decades, and if we don't do more to combat climate change, we won't have a place to ski.",2
California,Water—so fundamental to sustaining human life—is becoming more and more scarce.  How can we expect California to flourish economically if climate change is threatening the supply of such an essential resource?,2
California,Food shortage is a threat that could become reality if drought continues to plague California.,2
California,"California is home to so many endemic species specifically adapted to our region. As climate change continues to impact the earth, the biodiversity of our great state will plummet.",2
California,"Ecosystems exist in a delicate balance.  When something as significant as climate shifts, the ecosystems that we so heavily rely on will entirely fall apart.",2
California,Conservation of California's diverse and valuable ecosystems and natural places can only occur if we reduce our carbon emissions and stop global warming.,2
California,"Species diversity in California is declining, and species are going extinct at faster rates now than ever before.  If we don't curb emissions and stop climate change, there's no telling when the extinctions will stop.",2
California,"Human livelihood is so tightly linked to the health of our earth and its ecosystems. Climate change threatens California's ecosystems, and we need to reduce emissions to protect biodiversity.",2
California,"As a Californian, I care deeply about the natural world and the negative impacts climate change is incurring on it. I work hard to conserve resources, but I fear it will have been in vain if the government doesn't make a larger commitment to curbing carbon emissions and combatting climate change.",2
